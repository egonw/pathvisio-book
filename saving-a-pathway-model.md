## Graphical Pathway Markup Language (GPML)

Graphical Pathway Markup Language ([GPML](https://pathvisio.org/documentation/GPML)) is the native file format used store and edit pathway models in [PathVisio](https://pathvisio.org) and share them on [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways).

The current GPML version used is **GPML2021**. 

Please note that PathVisio 4.0.0 (which uses libGPML) works with GPML version 2021 and 2013a. When a pathway model written in GPML2013a is opened in PathVisio 4.x it will be ***automatically*** converted into GPML2021 when saved.
