# Why add information? 

As mentioned before, the [Ten simple rules for creating reusable pathway models for computational analysis and visualization](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009226) (Hanspers et al., 2021) paper provides guidelines for creating pathway models. Rules 5 and 6 in particular highlight the importance of adding information to pathway models. 

* Rule 5: Provide literature references, provenance, and evidence for pathway content
* Rule 6: Annotate pathway models with a title, a description, and ontology terms


In general machine readable information about the pathway or its pathway elements can... 

* Improve the findability and organization of the pathway models.
* Improve the readability and reusability of the pathway. 
* Be used to automatically filter pathway content by the presence and type of supporting evidence. 
* Support linking pathway model content to other databases and retrieval of additional information 

## Pathway information 
To the pathway, we can add: 

* Comments - descriptions or arbitrary notes for an object
* [Annotations](annotations.html)
* [Citations](citations.html)
* [Evidences](evidences.html)
* [Properties](properties.html)/[Pathway meta-information](pathway-meta-info.Rmd) - e.g. title, authors, etc. 

## Pathway element information 
To Pathway Elements we can add: 

* Comments - descriptions or arbitrary notes for an object
* [Annotations](annotations.html)
* [Citations](citations.html)
* [Evidences](evidences.html)
* [Properties](properties.html)
